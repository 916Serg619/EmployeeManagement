# EmployeeManagement
Employee Management system using node.js and MySQL

## Functionality
This app will alow the user to view, add, remove, and update employee data.  Each prompt will guide the user throug each option, and once the user is finished, eith they will return to the main screen with a graphic, or they can choose to disconnect from the server.

## Successes/Shortcomings
What I have suprisingly managed to achieve:  Generated a logo using asciiart-logo, got my main prompts to load, I can view employees, roles, and departments, I can add employees, roles, and departments (although, my answer doubles, as well as some of the prompts within the functions.)

Shortcomings:  I could not seem to get an update function to work.  I wanted to finish my remove functions, as well as my "view employy by manager" function, but I was stuck on properly adding data.  I still do not thik that I am doing it right.  

Overall, the app is somewhat functional,  and I will leave my work to show what I attempted as far as the other functions.
